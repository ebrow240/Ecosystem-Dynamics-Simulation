This Ecology simulation will demonstrate how "animal" populations behave when competing for resources. The populations will consist of at least one prey, one predator, and one energy resource. All entities will have variations with different traits that affect how they behave and interact with the simulation environment. Stochastic events will demonstrate the randomness of the real-world environment. Population, trait ratio, lifespan, events, and energy spread will be tracked and visualized. This will allow us to analyze how specific traits and behavior impacted the simulation. The simulation will be processed based on sequence components inside. The entities will be agents working in an agent-based model. However, these actions will be carried out via an FSM.
