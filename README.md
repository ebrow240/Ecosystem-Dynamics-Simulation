This is an agent-based simulation that models predator-prey dynamics, integrated with learning capabilities in an artificial ecosystem. The simulation examines the way adaptive behaviors drive population stability, competition for resources, and ecosystem resilience in changing environments. The Python and PyGame-driven project illustrates fundamental ecological principles with real-time visualization and comprehensive data analysis.  CHEER!

No special software is needed to run the application. All 10 scenarios run one after the other.

Key Features

Adaptive Prey Agent: Learning algorithms will enhance foraging efficiency by incorporating experience.

Energy-Based Lifecycles: Realistic metabolism, reproduction and survival mechanics

Dynamic Resource System: Food patches that regenerate over time; the availability can be tailored for specific needs.

10 Scenario Configurations: Predefined environmental conditions to be used for comparisons.

Real-time Visualization: PyGame interface displaying learning curves.

Comprehensive data gathering: CSV output with 50-tick interval sampling

Analysis of Parameter Sensitivity: Quantified impact of reproduction, predation, and resource parameters Validation Framework: face validation and extreme condition testing
